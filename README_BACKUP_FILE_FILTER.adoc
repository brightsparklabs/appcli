= BSL Application CLI Backup `file_filter` settings block

The `file_filter` block in the `stack-settings.yml` file allows for include and exclude lists to
be used when creating a backup. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)[Glob] pattern
matching is used to determine what files should be included or excluded from the `data` and
`conf` directories. Recursive glob patterns are enabled with the `**` notation.

Folder matches are ignored, only file matches will be placed in the backup and any necessary folders
to maintain the hierarchy.

== YML key definitions

=== file_filter

data_dir:: Include and exclude glob lists for the `data` directory.
conf_dir:: Include and exclude glob lists for the `conf` directory.

=== data_dir / conf_dir

include_list:: A list of globs used to match files that will be include in the backup. If left blank
or not present all files will be included.
exclude_list:: A list of globs used to match files that will be excluded from the backup. If left
blank or not present no files will be excluded.

# filename: stack-settings.yml

backups:
  - name: "a_name"
    file_filter:
      data_dir:
        include_list:
          -
        exclude_list:
          -
      conf_dir:
        include_list:
          -
        exclude_list:
          -
....

== Include lists

An include list specifies what files should be included in the backup. By default this will always
match all files, it does this by inserting `**/*` when there are no patterns or the key is not
present.

....
# filename: stack-settings.yml

backups:
  - name: "a_name"
    file_filter:
      data_dir:
        include_list:
          - "a glob"
....

== Exclude lists

An exclude list specifies what files should be excluded from the backup. By default this will not
match any files, it does this by inserting an empty glob pattern when there are no patterns or the
key is not present.

....
# filename: stack-settings.yml

backups:
  - name: "a_name"
    file_filter:
      data_dir:
        exclude_list:
          - "a glob"
....

== Examples

=== Backup everything

To create a backup that contains everything in the data and conf directories. Note this works
because the `file_filter` defaults to a complete recursive pattern (`**/*`) when omitted.

....
# filename: stack-settings.yml

backups:
  - name: "full_backups"
....

=== Only backup the data directory

To backup the `data` directory but ignore the `conf` directory a recursive pattern that matches
everything will need to be used in the exclude list `**/*`.

....
# filename: stack-settings.yml

backups:
  - name: "data_only"
    file_filter:
      conf_dir:
        exclude_list:
          - "**/*"
    frequency: "* * *"
....

=== Only backup `.log` files

To only backup data that ends with `.log` a recursive pattern looking for log files is needed
`**/*.log`.

....
# filename: stack-settings.yml

backups:
  - name: "logs"
    file_filter:
      conf_dir:
        include_list:
          - "**/*.log"
      data_dir:
        include_list:
          - "**/*.log"
    frequency: "* * *"
....

=== Backup the data root directory not including sub-folders

To backup the root directory of `data` a non-recursive wildcard pattern will be needed `*` for
the `include_list` on `data` and a fully recursive match `**/*` for `exclude_list` on
`conf`

Example directory:

....
data/
    search/
    engine/
    proxy/
    file1.yml
    file2.yml
    logs.log

conf/
    settings.yml
    stack-settings.yml
    .git/
....

Stack settings:

....
# filename: stack-settings.yml

backups:
  - name: "data_root"
    file_filter:
      conf_dir:
        exclude_list:
          - "**/*"
    data_dir:
      include_list:
        - "*"
    frequency:
....

Example match:

....
file1.yml
file2.yml
logs.log
....
